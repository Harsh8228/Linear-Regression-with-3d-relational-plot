# 🍌 Banana Quality Analysis & Prediction

📌 Project Overview
 - Analyzes banana quality based on multiple environmental and physical factors.
 - Uses data visualization and correlation analysis to understand key quality indicators.
 - Implements a Linear Regression model to predict banana quality scores.
   
📊 Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and structures dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Analysis:
 - Visualizes distributions and trends using Seaborn & Plotly.
 - Identifies correlations between features like ripeness, sugar content, and length.
Machine Learning:
 - Trains a Linear Regression model to predict quality scores.
 - Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

📈 Results
 - Achieved 96% accuracy (R² = 0.96) in predicting banana quality.
 - Identified key predictors like ripeness
